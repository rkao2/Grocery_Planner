# Grocery_Planner
A Grocery Planner is an application designed to help users organize and manage their grocery shopping. It allows users to add items they need to buy, track the prices, and manage their budget for groceries.

Inspiration: As a college student trying to budget effectively, this project also reflects my personal experiences and challenges, making it both relatable and impactful

Item List Creation: Users can add items they need to buy along with their prices. They may also categorize items or mark them as essential or optional.

Budget Tracking: The planner keeps track of a starting balance and updates it as items are added. This helps users manage their budget by showing the remaining balance after adding each item.

Item Details: Users might be able to add details like quantity, price, and type (e.g., perishable vs. non-perishable) for each item.

Perishable and Non-Perishable Items: For groceries, items may have different characteristics. Perishable items (like fruits, vegetables, dairy) may have expiration dates, while non-perishables (like canned goods, pasta) do not. This feature can help users plan shopping trips according to items' shelf lives.

Total Cost Calculation: The app can automatically calculate the total cost of all items added, making it easy to track spending.

Display and Print Shopping List: Once the user has added all their items, they can view a summary list. Some apps even offer the option to print or share the list.

Additional Features: Some grocery planners may include reminders, recipe ideas, or integration with online stores.
